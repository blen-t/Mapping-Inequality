# Mapping Inequality Data Cleaning
Team: Blen, Lina, Dua, Sanjeev

Project Description: Mapping_Inequality.csv is a large dataset that our team detected and corrected corrupt/inaccurate records as well as replacing, modifying, and deleting the dirty/coarse data to be able to easily view and understand the data. We used Jupyter Notebook for this project.
